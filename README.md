# FRCS Auto-Viva
These [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) presentations are available free for anyone who wants to practice for the FRCS Tr&Orth. Enjoy and good luck.

# How to use them
These presentations should work on any computer, tablet or phone. They are branching, so using the left and right arrow keys stays at the 'top level' allowing you to cycle through the questions. Use the up and down arrow keys to see the answers. You can swipe too, if you like that sort of thing.
